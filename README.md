# MY LEARNING

Through this simple activity, I learned how to use a Groovy script to create a Jenkins pipeline that performs specific tasks. I also learned how to modify the pipeline—for example, by adding a cleanup stage—and observed how the stages update accordingly. Additionally, I was able to view the build history reflecting these changes.
